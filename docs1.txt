1. Clarity of Problem (Max: 2)
Defined Problem:
This project addresses the challenge of segmenting and enhancing meaningful regions in images through unsupervised learning. It is relevant in fields like medical imaging, remote sensing, and photo editing.

✅ Score Justification: The problem is clearly defined and applicable to real-world image processing.

2. Technical Approach and Innovation (Max: 6)
Approach Overview:

Utilizes Fuzzy C-Means clustering for image segmentation.

Converts high-dimensional color data into clusters with soft memberships.

Employs advanced cluster quality metrics: Davies-Bouldin Index, WCSS, and Silhouette Score.

Implements a dedicated enhancement function to adjust brightness and contrast for a selected cluster.

Innovation Aspects:

Combines fuzzy logic with image enhancement.

Modular code suitable for extension (e.g., spatial features, grayscale processing).

Provides interpretable and interactive cluster feedback.

✅ Score Justification: The methods are well-explained, technically sound, and show innovation in combining clustering and enhancement.

3. Results and Evaluation (Max: 4)
What Was Done:

The system outputs individual clusters, combined segmented image, and enhancement results.

Quantitative evaluation via:

DBI – for compactness/separation.

Silhouette Score – for cluster appropriateness.

WCSS – for internal variance.

Presentation:

Cluster centers (colors) and segmented images are clearly visualized using matplotlib.

✅ Score Justification: Results are effectively presented using appropriate visual and numerical metrics.

4. Critical Reflection (Max: 4)
Discussed Limitations & Improvements:

Potential limitations include:

RGB-only input (no spatial features considered).

Manual cluster count input (no auto-selection).

Improvement paths:

Include spatial coordinates in clustering.

Automate optimal cluster detection.

Enable GUI or web-based interactive cluster editing.

✅ Score Justification: Clear awareness of scope and room for future improvements is demonstrated.

5. Visual Presentation and Overall Impression (Max: 4)
Poster/Code Strengths:

Well-structured visual output showing step-by-step image transformation.

Clean comparison of original, clustered, and enhanced outputs.

Modular functions enhance readability and reusability.

✅ Score Justification: Visually organized, easy to follow, and leaves a professional impression.
